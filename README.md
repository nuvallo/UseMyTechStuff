# UseMyTechStuff

Rent tech equipment from real people!

# MVP:

1. Two user types: `owner`s and `renter`s

2. `user` can login and create a profile

3. `user` can then setup items they have `for rent` such as cameras, TV's, party equipment such as speakers/fog machines, etc.

4. `user` will be able to create, read, update and delete rental data. A second `user` can login and see `items` that users have `for rent` and ask to `rent` an `item`

# Stretch:

1. Add a payment option into the application allowing a `user` to pay over Paypal / Stripe etc. to `rent` their `item`s

2. Be able to schedule a `time` and `place` for pick-up

3. Add a `review` system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that `user`s are legitimate.
